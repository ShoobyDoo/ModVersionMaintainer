Hello. You are seeing this disclaimer because it is the first time you are running this program.
As such, here's a few things you should know about this program right off the bat.

As you know, this is a program that is setting out to maintain all your mods and their respective updates
in a very lightweight and almost entirely autonomous manner. In order to do so however...

1. This program will be connecting to an external website (curseforge) to check for mod updates.
2. You will have the option to download said updates to your computer; hence "Mod Version Maintainer".

Normally, you should be weary of any program that performs these sorts of actions because downloading 
random files from the internet obviously isn't safe.

For that reason and in this case, I have spent a lot of effort in extensively documenting the source code 
so even if you don't understand code you can still follow along with what the program is doing.

You can read in full on GitHub at: https://github.com/ShoobyDoo/ModVersionMaintainer

Sorry for all that, but it's important you know what this file you have just downloaded run is doing. 

If you understand and would like to continue, please just enter y or yes below. 
If you don't, just enter n or no and the program will exit. 

(You will only see this message once.)
